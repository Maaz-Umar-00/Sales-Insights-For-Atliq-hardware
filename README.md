Atliq Hardware is seeking to better understand the factors behind its declining sales and profitability in order to make informed business decisions. The company aims to gain insights into regional sales performance, customer behavior, and market trends to improve overall profitability and optimize sales strategies.

## Key Objectives:

   - Identify regions with declining sales and profitability.
   - Compare performance across different regions to pinpoint opportunities for improvement.

2. **Assess Profit Margins**  
   - Identify areas where profitability can be improved and develop strategies for margin optimization.

3. **Optimize Store and Product Performance**  
   - Analyze store performance to understand which stores are contributing most to revenue.
   - Determine underperforming products and identify opportunities to increase sales.


By addressing these objectives, we aim to provide Atliq Hardware with the insights needed to optimize their sales operations and drive business growth.
