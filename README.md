## Overveiw
**Atliq Hardware, an India-based company,** is seeking to gain a deeper understanding of the factors contributing to its **declining sales** and **profitability.** The company aims to analyze various aspects of its business, including **regional sales performance, customer behavior,** and **market trends.** By obtaining these insights, **Atliq Hardware plans to enhance its overall profitability and refine its sales strategies.** This data-driven approach will enable the company to make informed decisions and improve its competitive edge in the market.

## Findings and Recommendations
1.# Atliq Hardware Revenue Analysis

- **Atliq Hardware's revenue peaked at $43 million in 2018, but declined by approximately 65% to $15 million by 2020.**
- **Atliq Hardware** could consider implementing a subscription model for regular customers, allowing them to receive monthly supplies at a discounted rate, thereby ensuring steady revenue.

2. **Atliq Hardware** receives the highest revenue from **Delhi NCR**, where profits are also higher; however, the **profit margin** is surprisingly very low. 

To address this issue, the company should analyze cost structures in the region to identify inefficiencies and explore opportunities for reducing operational costs. Additionally, focusing on premium product offerings could enhance profit margins while attracting discerning customers.

3. **The highest profit margin** for Atliq Hardware is from **Surat city**, showcasing strong profitability. However, in contrast, the profit margin in **Bengaluru** is declining and moving into the **negative.** 

To mitigate the declining profits in **Bengaluru,** the company should reassess its pricing strategy and consider reducing non-essential expenditures in that region. Additionally, conducting a market analysis to understand **changing customer preferences** could help identify new opportunities for growth.
